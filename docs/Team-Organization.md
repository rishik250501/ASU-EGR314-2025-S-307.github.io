## Team Charter
Our goal is to create a design that encourages hands-on interaction. It should feature a device that families can engage with, triggering a physical response. We aim to provide an educational experience, engagingly teaching children something new. The design should be affordable, durable, and built to last. Additionally, it should be easy for families to assemble and disassemble for repeated use.

## Product Mission Statement
Our mission is to design and develop interactive, web-enabled devices that showcase key scientific and engineering concepts engagingly. By using simple, modular designs that follow common standards, the team aims to help people better understand these concepts in an engaging way.
