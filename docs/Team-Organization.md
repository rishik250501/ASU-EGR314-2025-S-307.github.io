## Team Charter
*Make a project that actually works!*

My Team members have not communicated other common goals to form a better charter.

## Product Mission Statement
Our mission is to design and develop interactive, web-enabled devices that showcase key scientific and engineering concepts engagingly. By using simple, modular designs that follow common standards, the team aims to help people better understand these concepts in an engaging way.
