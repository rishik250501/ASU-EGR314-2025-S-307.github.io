## Team Organization


**Team Charter:**
Our goal is to create a design that encourages hands-on interaction. It should feature a device that families can engage with, triggering a physical response. We aim to provide an educational experience, engagingly teaching children something new. The design should be affordable, durable, and built to last. Additionally, it should be easy for families to assemble and disassemble for repeated use.

## Product Mission Statement
Our mission is to design and develop interactive, web-enabled devices that showcase key scientific and engineering concepts engagingly. By using simple, modular designs that follow common standards, the team aims to help people better understand these concepts in an engaging way.

### <u>Team Goals</u>
- Conceptualize and create a product that demonstrates a notable advancement in complexity compared to our previous project in EGR 304.
- Proficiently apply our expertise in PCB design, aiming to enhance our competence using the industry-standard PCB design tool, Cadence.
- Strengthen our practical skills in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Programming, fostering continual growth in these areas.
- Maintain effective and consistent communication within the team to ensure seamless collaboration.
- Strive to surpass project deadlines by working towards early completion, showcasing our commitment to efficiency and excellence.

## <u> Communication Procedures </u>
Our team will be communicating primarily through Discord. For meetings that require all members to be present, in person meeting is preferable but if all members can not attend, such meeting will be done via Zoom or a Discord video call.

Communication to the instructor will be handled via email in which the person will tag the rest of the team in the correspondence. 

### <u>Roles & Responsibilities</u>

| Role | Duties |
|------|--------|
| Meeting leader | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting |
| Meeting recorder | Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned. Submits assignments. |
| Project monitor | Tracks the teamâ€™s progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status |

For our team, project roles are to be picked voluntarily, and once assigned, they are to remain in that role unless there is an accommodation that is required that prevents them from satisfying said position. This should be communicated in advance. In such a scenario, a consensus will be reached among the team members for who is best capable to fulfill the role switch or the responsibilities of the role in question can be distributed among the different roles. However, if a role switch is not required but only assistance is, any role is allowed to assist at any time. 

Projects will be kept on track through the use of a Gantt chart via Smartsheet. And the team leader will be responsible for ensuring that all requirements are met among the team members. 

The current roles for the project are as follows:
- Meeting leader - Rishik
- Meeting recorder - Sophie 
- Project monitor - James

### <u>Team Coordination & Accountability</u>
To complete assignments as a team, we will begin with a general meeting about what needs to be done. Outside of hard scheduled meet times, all team members can work on the project at any time. However, the assignment must be completed the day before, including the quality check. The assignment will then be submitted by the Meeting Recorder. To ensure the assignment is completed successfully all members will be required to report on which portion of the assignment they will best be able to assist. However, the final say will go to the Assignment Leader. Making sure everyone on the team is informed of the design review will fall under the task of the Project Monitor.
